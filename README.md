Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Multiple linear regression is a statistical model that extends the scope and flexibility of a simple linear regression model. Instead of using a single independent variable to account for all variability observed in the dependent variable, a multiple linear regression uses multiple independent variables to account for parts of the total variance observed in the dependent variable.
