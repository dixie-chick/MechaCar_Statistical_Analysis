statistical analyses and visualizations using R


Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Multiple linear regression is a statistical model that extends the scope and flexibility of a simple linear regression model. Instead of using a single independent variable to account for all variability observed in the dependent variable, a multiple linear regression uses multiple independent variables to account for parts of the total variance observed in the dependent variable.
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
