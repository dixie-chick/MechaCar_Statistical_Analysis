## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Multiple linear regression is a statistical model that extends the scope and flexibility of a simple linear regression model. Instead of using a single independent variable to account for all variability observed in the dependent variable, a multiple linear regression uses multiple independent variables to account for parts of the total variance observed in the dependent variable.

### Key Takeaway
1. The non-random variable variance should be 0, meaning the 
2. 
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Let's run the summaries on the datasets:

### Key Takeaway
Lots1 and Lots2 are in line with the mandated 100 pounds per square inch, however the variance for Lots3 exceeds the set PSI making it not compliance with design specs for MechaCar suspsension coils.  

## T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

### Key Takeaway:

## Study Design:  MechaCar vs the Competition
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
- Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
